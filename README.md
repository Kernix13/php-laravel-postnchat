# PHP and Laravel Post and Chat App

-   coming soon...

## To-Do Items

1. ✅ Create a separate controller for admin-only routes (`AdminController.php`) for future functionality changes or added functionality
2. ✅ Create a separate controller for chat routes (`ChatController.php`) for future functionality changes or added functionality
3. ✅ Create a separate controller for profile routes (`ProfileController.php`) instead of using UserController, including `/manage-avatar` routes.

> ProfileController may not make sense since there is no Profile model

4. `<footer>` should be fixed to the bottom of the page either with flex or position

## Setup

Here are the initial commands you will need:

```sh
composer install
npm install
php artisan serve
```
